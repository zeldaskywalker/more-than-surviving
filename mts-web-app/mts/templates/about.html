        <h1 id="the-project">THE PROJECT</h1>

        <p>More Than Surviving is first and foremost a celebration of Wampanoag political agency, ingenuity, and
            persistence. Although this project currently focuses on the antebellum era (1832–1860; leading up to the
            Civil War), at any point in Wampanoag history, there are ample instances of activity that embody a core
            cultural understanding of the interconnectivity and value of all beings. This underlying worldview comes to
            life in many different forms. This project seeks to explore its expression via political action. </p>
        <h3>Beyond the Colonial Period</h3>
        <P>Most Americans are not aware of the Wampanoag—their impact on American history or their continued presence on
            their homelands today. They show up in US history during the colonial era; the Wampanoag were on the
            frontlines of English colonial oppression, as their homelands are situated in eastern Massachusetts
            including Cape Cod and the Islands and eastern Rhode Island. The “Indians” the pilgrims encountered were the
            Wampanoag—as were the warriors present at the widely sensationalized first Thanksgiving, yet “Wampanoag” is
            still an unknown name to most. US history often relegates Indigenous people to background texture by
            replacing their individual names and cultures with a general “Indians” or by hiding them in plain sight by
            under-identifying individuals in favor of a strict racial binary with room only for the labels “black” and
            “white.” By failing to name Indigenous people fully, it becomes easier to situate them exclusively in the
            past, erasing their continued presence. A faulty and harmful concept of racial purity—“The last of…”— erases
            the profound and foundational impact of the passage of cultural beliefs and practices, independent of blood
            quantums, that sustain a people through centuries of oppression as it has the Wampanoag. </P>
        <h3>A Culture of Connectivity and Care</h3>
        <p>Wampanoag culture traditionally and in practice acknowledges and speaks to a person’s humanity, not their
            skin color—with behaviors rooted in an understanding of our interconnectivity. This is evidenced in
            Massasoit Ousamequin’s (Yellow Feather) generosity and empathy towards the first European settlers at
            Plimouth. Despite the Europeans immediately stealing winter food caches and robbing burial grounds,
            Ousamequin chose to help them survive their first winter and offered guidance and support in cultivating and
            understanding the land. One must imagine the extreme position of empathy and recognition of the desperation
            of these “others'' to allow for such a generous response. This project proposes that, as displayed by
            Ousamequin, Wampanoag cultural understanding of our interconnectivity with all beings is also evidenced in
            their rescue of refugees from slavery, their intermarriage and adoption of people of all backgrounds, their
            defense of communal land practices, and their petitions for racial equality, among other things.</p>
        <h3>Intersection of Activity</h3>
        <p>The Indigenous activists and events featured in this iteration of the project are focused tightly in the
            years 1830–1850, partially due to the constraint of resources (time), and because this period was a
            specifically active period in the United States for political, social and moral reform advocacy. The
            political and social impact of the Second Great Awakening and the industrialization of the nation was on
            full display via organizations fighting for Indigenous rights, workers’ rights, women’s rights, racial
            equality, temperance, and the end of slavery—and the Wampanoag were right there not just witnessing, but
            taking action.</p>
        <h3>Indigenous Relationship to Homelands</h3>
        <p>Although many of their activities overlapped with other issues that concerned non-Indigenous people, land
            rights is a uniquely prominent issue specific to Indigenous communities. Just as it is today, the seizing
            and lack of access to homelands was a perpetual threat. Many Wampanoag petitions to the state call out the
            looting of natural resources and absorption of land by neighboring whites. When the colonists arrived, there
            were some 69 tribes with a multitude of villages across the Wampanoag Nation. By the 19th century just a
            small fraction of these communities remained. </p>
        <p>Traditionally, Wampanoag practiced communal land management. Prior to colonization no individual plots
            existed—everyone lived in a village setting in the spring, fall, and winter. During part of the spring and
            summer, clans set up fish camps and gardens to prepare smoked foods for winter months, with the lands
            regulated by Clan Mothers. With the arrival of colonization, Wampanoag practices changed—plots were tended
            by specific families, while unclaimed lands were used for common purposes. Plots could be passed down within
            families, but when there was no heir, it returned to the communal pool. </p>
        <p>This relationship with land was in stark contrast with the American belief that ownership and exploitation of
            land were key features of liberty and citizenship. Even the influential leader of the American Anti-Slavery
            Society, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Lloyd-Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>,
            came out against the Massachusetts policy that distinguished Mashpee, the
            largest Indigenous community in Massachusetts, as a communally owned district. He insisted that such a
            policy was paternalistic and deprived the Mashpee of their right to exercise the freedom to sell (profit
            from) their land. He likely considered this in line with <a
                href="https://www.massmoments.org/moment-details/indians-in-mashpee-demand-self-government.html">his
                earlier support</a> of Mashpee’s successful fight
            for independence. In reality, he showed his, and many Americans’, fundamental inability to grasp the
            cultural significance of communal land practices in favor of superimposing an individualistic and
            capitalistic framework. Mashpee was eventually illegally incorporated into the state of Massachusetts and
            forced to sell large swaths of land. </p>
        <h3>Project Methods</h3>
        <p>More Than Surviving presents Wampanoag political activities in the context of Wampanoag homelands via the
            interactive map as documentation of their continued presence—and as a bridge to understanding that this
            presence extends into the present day. The timeline offers context in relation to national and state events,
            demonstrating Wampanoag awareness of the issues of the day, and their commitment to join the struggle even
            when the outcomes did not directly impact their own communities. Many of the important moments in US history
            that historians discuss from this era, Wampanoag participated in—whether that was housing Frederick Douglass
            as part of the underground railroad or publishing Indigenous perspectives in The Liberator, the official
            newspaper of the American Anti-Slavery Society.
        </p>
        <p>Looking into the future, we anticipate expanding the project — filling in activities in both directions of
            the timeline to demonstrate the continuous cultural expression of Wampanoag expressions of agency, ingenuity
            and persistence. From first contact through to today, there are powerful examples of Wampanoag culture
            expressed through political activities rooted in the understanding of the interconnectivity of all beings.

        <p>The map of Wampanoag political activity and activists is powered by <a
                href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/">Mapbox GL JS</a>, a JavaScript mapping library. The
            map highlights activism, as well as key locations associated with activists, and allows viewers to make
            connections between events and activists across various Wampanoag communities. The goal of the map is to
            reinforce Wampanoag presence in their homeland.</p>

        <h3>TIMELINE</h3>
        <H4>TIMELINEJS</H4>
        <p>The timeline of Wampanoag political activity is powered by <a
                href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">TimelineJS</a>, an open source timeline creation tool developed
            by Northwestern University's Knight Lab. The timeline includes key events in Wampanoag activism from the
            antebellum period, juxtaposed alongside related events in Massachusetts and United States history. The goal
            of the timeline is to illustrate the progression and persistence of Wampanoag activism and help viewers
